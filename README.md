# software-artist

Hello, I'm Tonia Gonzalez. I am a software engineer and a printmaker. This repo is my current resume & art portfolio. The initial template was forked from [tailnext](https://github.com/onwidget/tailnext) and the site is hosted on Vercel. It can be viewed at [toniagonzalez.com](https://toniagonzalez.com/).

### Running locally
