  subtitle1:
    `I have a bachelor's degree in Studio Art and a bachelor's degree in Arabic. While those two subjects may seem like the opposite ends of the communications spectrum I have found that software engineering has been a happy meeting in the middle between my analytical and creative interests.`,
  subtitle2:
    `When I am not coding Iâ€™ll most likely be doing one of the following: baking something up in the kitchen, going on a hike, bird watching, planting my garden, sketching, playing board games with my husband, meditating or looking up at the stars.`,
